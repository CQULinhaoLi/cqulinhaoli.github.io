Research Experience
======

* Jul. 2023 – Present: Research Intern  
  * Information Processing and Intelligent Systems Lab, Chongqing University  
  * Conducted research on multi-source data fusion and uncertainty modeling:
    - Proposed a novel Generalized Quantum Basic Belief Assignment (GQBBA) generation method based on Generalized Quantum Evidence Theory (GQET) for heterogeneous data.
    - Improved classification performance in complex systems with ambiguous information.
    - Focused on robust decision-making under uncertainty.  
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Fuyuan Xiao](https://www.cse.cqu.edu.cn/info/2095/5902.htm)


* Mar. 2025 – Apr. 2025: Research Intern  
  * [Fudan Vision and Learning Lab (FVL)](https://fvl.fudan.edu.cn/), Fudan University  
  * Focused on object tracking in real-world videos:
    - Annotated 6000+ frames across 9 videos, addressing occlusion, motion blur, and target disappearance.
    - Optimized the annotation pipeline using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for efficiency and temporal consistency.
    - Contributed to refining annotation strategies through team discussions on ambiguous cases.  
  * Supervisor: [Prof. Henghui Ding](https://henghuiding.com/)
