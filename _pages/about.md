## 👋 Welcome

Hi! I'm Linhao Li (李林豪), an undergraduate student majoring in **Data Science and Big Data Technology** at **Chongqing University**, China. I’m currently in my third year and spent a semester as an **exchange student in Computer Science** at the **University of Macau**. My academic and research focus lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Healthcare**, with a strong interest in **Multimodal** and **Computational Pathology**.

## 🎯 Research Interests

- **AI for Healthcare** – developing intelligent systems to assist medical analysis, diagnosis, and decision-making.
- **Multimodal** – combining diverse data types (e.g., DNA/RNA sequences, image, biological signals) to improve predictive performance.
- **Computational Pathology** – applying machine learning and computer vision to histopathological images and biomedical data.

## 🔬 Research Experience

At the **Information Processing and Intelligent Systems Lab** (Chongqing University), I conducted research on **multi-source information fusion** and **uncertainty modeling**, aiming to improve classification performance in complex systems. I proposed a novel approach based on **Generalized Quantum Evidence Theory (GQET)** to handle uncertainty in heterogeneous data fusion scenarios. The method achieved superior results compared to traditional fusion techniques, particularly in tasks requiring robust decision-making under ambiguity.

At the **Fudan Vision and Learning Lab (FVL)** (Fudan University), I worked as a research intern on a project involving **video annotation for object tracking in real-world scenarios**. I annotated over **6000 frames across 9 videos**, addressing challenges such as occlusion, motion blur, and target disappearance. Using the **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**, I optimized the annotation pipeline for both efficiency and temporal consistency. I also actively engaged in discussions on ambiguous cases and refined annotation strategies.
