## 👋 Welcome

Hi! I'm Linhao Li (李林豪), an undergraduate student majoring in **Data Science and Big Data Technology** at **Chongqing University**, China. I’m currently in my third year and spent a semester as an **exchange student in Computer Science** at the **University of Macau**. My academic and research focus lies at the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Healthcare**, with a strong interest in **Multimodal** and **Computational Pathology**.

## 🎯 Research Interests

- **AI for Healthcare** – developing intelligent systems to assist medical analysis, diagnosis, and decision-making.
- **Multimodal** – combining diverse data types (e.g., DNA/RNA sequences, image, biological signals) to improve predictive performance.
- **Computational Pathology** – applying machine learning and computer vision to histopathological images and biomedical data.

## 🔬 Research Experience

At the **Information Processing and Intelligent Systems Lab** (Chongqing University), I work on **multi-source information fusion** and **uncertainty modeling**, applying these techniques to enhance classification tasks in complex systems. I proposed a method based on **Generalized Quantum Evidence Theory (GQET)**, improving uncertainty handling in fusion scenarios, and achieved promising results surpassing traditional models.

Additionally, I independently explored **wound localization in animal models**, designing machine learning pipelines to estimate wound dimensions from biomedical images. These hands-on projects deepened my passion for computational approaches to healthcare challenges.
